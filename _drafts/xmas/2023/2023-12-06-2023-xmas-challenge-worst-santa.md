## The Details

  {% include image.html id="gary-santa" style="max-height: 300px" %}

My worst Santa is Gary Sinise as the gun-running truck driver, Gabriel who decides to orchestrate a robbery of a casino on Christmas Eve. Why is he the worst? Surely there are worse Santas. Well, THIS Santa decides to rip off an _indian_ casino, and so for this assault on my indigenous peoples of Michigan, Gabriel takes the prize. 

{% include image.html id="indians" style="max-height: 300px" %}

Gary plays an over-the-hill, truck-driving grunge fan in the year 2000. This Eddie Vedder on bath salts is brutish, egotistcial, and clueless who demonstrates zero skills to lead a crew in criminal activity saves for TWO qualifications 

1. an uncanny ability steer an Oldsmobile Cutlass on the snowy Michigan backroads, and;
2. ......he is an expert **dart chucker**.

As a Santa, Gabriel, shows zero compassion for children (he and his crew kick 2 kids off of pinball machines so they can use Ben Affleck as a dart baord in peace). He is also an abusive boyfriend to Charlize Theron. And.....wears the most RIDICULOUS pair of fingerless driving gloves for being in a Michigan winter.

While the 2nd half of this film being extremely entertaining (and a superb part by Dennis Farina playing a version of this Get Shorty character), and there being a nice little twist ending, Gabriel deserves one last reprimand for his Christmas activities. Had it not been for Gabriel's criminal hijinks, {% include image.html id="cash" style="max-height: 168px; float: right" %} Ben Affleck, would not end up making THE WORST Christmas Act of Kindness - PUTTING STACKS OF **INDIAN** CASH IN THE MAILBOXES OF ALL THE TOWN RESIDENTS. Why is this a terrible idea? BECUASE in a few days, EVERYONE in town is going to be inconvenienced by having to return this very cash since A LOCAL CASINO WAS JUST ROBBED. Another white man stealing from the Indians and causing a mess....and I blame Gary Sinise.
