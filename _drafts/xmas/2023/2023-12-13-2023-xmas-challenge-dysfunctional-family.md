## The Details


Most dysfunctional family goes to Santa and Bob Newhart. 

{% include image.html id="santa" style="max-width: 200px" %}{% include image.html id="newhart" style="max-width: 200px" %}

To recap, Will Ferrell's Elf as an orphan baby crawled into Santa's sack of gifts on Christmas Eve during his annual visit to the orphanage. Seems like a reasonable premise, but, by Gawd..... let's think about this. 

{% include image.html id="baby" style="float: left; max-width: 350px" %}

- Does Santa **NOT** empty his sack of gifts before returning to the North Pole? Would he not discover the baby mid-trip? 
- Understanding that the sack was made by the same fashion designer who created Mary Poppin's handbag and Newton Scamander's suitcase could explain how the sack might have the magical powers to keep a baby warm (and deep) enough to survie the trip.

{% include image.html id="newt" style="max-width: 350px" %}{% include image.html id="hangbag" style="max-width: 350px" %}

- But, upon finding the baby, Santa and Bob Newhart don't think to return it to the orphanage? Was this not a good idea because Santa was lazy? The orphanage was EMPTY. Meaning its pretty darn good a placing baby orphans with HUMAN FAMILIES. **WHAT IS THE RATIONALE BEHIND KEEPING THIS MAN BEAST IN THE NORTH POLE?**

**#1 - Santa and Bob Newhart have committed a kidnapping.** In NYC, it's a [class A-I felony](https://criminaldefense.1800nynylaw.com/new-york-penal-law-135-25-kidnapping-in-the-first-degree.html#:~:text=Kidnapping%20in%20the%20first%20degree%20is%20a%20class%20A%2DI%20felony,would%20be%2015%2D40%20years.) - minimum 15-40 yrs up to life in PRISON, suckah. And there's no one to hold them accountable. How much creedence does THIS give to Santa's naughty list?! This kid was right to question Santa's naughty list - he SHOULD have his beard punched off!

{% include image.html id="punch" style="max-width: 350px" %}

**#2 - This so-called family at the North Pole can't build Elf a proper bed?!**. Yes, they can build 1,000 Etch-a-Sketches in 1 day, but can't take the time to build him a bed. Let alone a decent living structure. They **prefer** to sadistically force him to sleep in disarray. 

{% include image.html id="bed" style="max-width: 350px" %}{% include image.html id="shower" style="max-height: 233px" %}

**#3 - They clearly haven't prepared him ever to be a human**.  BUT! BUT!! They are gonna let him go to NYC, of all places. With the mind of a 6yr old. Santa and Bob Newhart are a piece, man. No wonder Elf was prepared to meet the worst father in the world and BE OKAY with it.
