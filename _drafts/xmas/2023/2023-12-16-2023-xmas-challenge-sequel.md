## The Details

HA2 is my favorite sequel for 3 reasons:
**1. A few days during the holiday free of obligations.**

{% include image.html id="ice-cream" style="float:left; max-width: 350px; padding: 10px" %}We get to live the fantasy of having a few guilt-free days thanks to the hapless gate agents of American Airlines. You camp out in a huge hotel room, watching movies with ice cream sundae room service (to the tune of $976). Even then, when you wanted to get around NYC, a limo will take you there with free pizza. AND, you feel ZERO guilt when tipping with strips of Fruit Stripe. 

**2. The bird lady.**

{% include image.html id="ice-cream" style="float:right; max-width: 350px; padding: 10px" %}I feel her story, and the friendship Kevin and she develops is so interesting. It could've followed a number of cliches, but instead is allowed to be something more beautiful.  It's also an evolution for Kevin's character from the first film in that he isn't so afraid of life's misfits like Old Man Marley. (Note: the part is played wonderfully by Brenda Fricker, whom I remember most as Mike Myer's mother from 'So I Married an Axe Murderer'.)

**3. The most amazing sequence of traps.**

{% include image.html id="flaming-head" style="float:left; max-width: 350px; padding: 10px" %}The best part of Christopher Columbus' directing, is cutting away from the most brutal payoffs letting our imagination take over. (Joe Pesci's slow descent into a toilet of chemicals to relieve his flaming head?) My gawd. Only to be taunted with the biting words of a blonde haired, blue-eyed devil, "I'm down here, you big horse's @ss". Kevin becomes a Christmas justice for adult evildoers. He's the Krampus of Christmas Criminals, and boy do these criminals take a savage beating.
