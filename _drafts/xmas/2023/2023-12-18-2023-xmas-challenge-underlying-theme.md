## The Details

Gremlins is scary, good fun with a finger-wagging tale for those chasing the "American dream" a little too hard. The film is narrated by its most hard-headed character - Billy's father the inventor. He's so pre-occupied with his selling his dim-witted inventions, that's he's ignored his family. To make it up to his son, he purchases the perfect Christmas gift - a Mogwai named Gizmo. Except he didn't really purchase it. The shop-owner's grandson steals Gizmo to sell to Rand after his grandfather refused to sell. Why did he not want to sell? Because owning a Mogwai isn't so easy - it requires great responsibility. And since grandfather never intended to sell, he never spoke of the consequences. Mayhem ensues as the rules were not followed.

Like all good Puritans, I love a biting cautionary tale. I see the theme being the unintended, unknown consequences of exploiting {INSERT YOUR FAVORITE THING HERE} for our own self-interest. I think the film is talking about nature (what even is a Mogwai? And who learned the rules in the first place?), I would say you could replace nature with whatever. It could be other people, our relationships,  our natural gifts and talents, or our time! I feel this especially at Thanksgiving. We get to be exploited as Black Friday now extends right through (Cyber) Monday! We can't even enjoy Thanksgiving no' mo'. As soon as that turkey dinner is over, we be SHOPPING. Fridee. Saddee. Sundee. and now Mondee? Christmas doesn't invade Thanksgiving. Corporations don't (as much as I'd like to blame them). We invade Thanksgiving. We do. We do it to ourselves, our families. For various reasons. (For more, Thanksgiving/Christmas clashes, check out Eli Roth's Thanksgiving(2023) film.)[INSERT HOWARD DEAN SCREAM!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5FzCeV0ZFc&t=85s). 

At the end of the film, the inventor apologizes to the shopowner, "But I didn't mean it!". (Of course we didn't).
