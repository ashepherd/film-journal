## The Details

  {% include image.html id="poster" style="max-height: 168px" %} 

Like all good Puritans, I love a biting cautionary tale. I see the theme being the unintended, unknown consequences of exploiting {INSERT YOUR FAVORITE THING HERE} for our own self-interest. I think the film is talking about nature (what even is a Mogwai? And who learned the rules in the first place?), I would say you could replace nature with whatever. It could be other people, our relationships,  our natural gifts and talents, or our time! I feel this especially at Thanksgiving. We get to be exploited as Black Friday now extends right through (Cyber) Monday! We can't even enjoy Thanksgiving no' mo'. As soon as that turkey dinner is over, we be SHOPPING. Fridee. Saddee. Sundee. and now Mondee? Christmas doesn't invade Thanksgiving. Corporations don't (as much as I'd like to blame them). We invade Thanksgiving. We do. We do it to ourselves, our families. For various reasons. (For more, Thanksgiving/Christmas clashes, check out Eli Roth's Thanksgiving(2023) film.)[INSERT HOWARD DEAN SCREAM!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5FzCeV0ZFc&t=85s). 

At the end of the film, the inventor apologizes to the shopowner, "But I didn't mean it!". (Of course we didn't).
