## The Details

It's July in Toyland, Santa visits to see how his order of 600 1" toy soldiers is going...only to find that Laurel and Hardy took the order and the Toy Master has produced 100 of them at 6' tall! On top of that, Silus Barnaby holds an overdue mortgage on the Old Lady Who lived in a Shoe, but will release the mortgage if she agrees to allow him to marry Little Bo Beep. 

Laurel & Hardy dimwittedly plot and scheme to release the mortgage so that Bo Beep can marry her true love, the Pied Piper. This film is GREAT! It's a evhicel for Laurel & Hardy skits woven into the Babes in Toyland story. it has rewatchable scenes, hilarious antics, & songs that'll stick in your head. The score is nothing short of amazing. The physical comedy and wordplay are LOL. And the invasion of the Bogeymen is grand! If you love the Three Stooges or the Marx brothers, you are in for a holiday treat!

Scenes: peewee boomerang scenes (and it's payoff at the end), the toymaker's factory, the fake wedding, the dunk tank, toy soldiers fending off the bogeyman, and the DARTS!! Oh the DARTS!
