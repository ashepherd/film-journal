## The Gist

I just love this movie. It's not terribly subtle with the reveal, but it is gentle. I've seen this movie pop up on dysfunctional family lists, and I couldn't disagree more. It's quite the opposite - a family that talks and shares with each other. Openly struggles to integrate someone new.  They are honest and open, and they are themselves with each other. What a gift. This film is a love letter to family at Christmas, and being thankful for each other - that we get to share it. Gawd, that scene when Diane Keaton signs at the table.....(Ok, I still don't buy Luke Wilson rizzin' the hell out of Jessica Parker - ain't no way).
