## The Gist

9 storylines. Nine. Nueve. Neun. Neuf. Ni. 9. Storylines. NINE. Nein. Nein. Nein. Nein.

.....most anthology films, have like 3 storylines. Creepshow? 3. Trilogy of Terror? (3 is in the name). 3, people. 3.

Where is Raul, the vice director of a Venezuelan parks department, when we need him?? 9 storylines? Right to Jail (you too, [Short Cuts (1993)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108122/))

OK, look I'll be honest. I haven't seen it since we first rented it on DVD. Maybe, at the time, I had been forced to watch too much of 'The O.C.' {% include image.html id="oc" style="float: left; padding: 10px; max-width: 350px" %} and I couldn't handle anymore love. So, I reserve the right to rewatch it this Christmas season and change my mind. Until then, I remember feeling this movie had the broad brushstrokes of all the romantic/love things. And, Yes, it's cameo city. But who cares? You got nine stories, you NEED recognizable faces. There isn't enough time to develop a character. But maybe they weren't going for developed characters. Maybe they wanted to bang on the piano and see what horrid sights and sound arose.

9 storylines hasn't been done well until Game of Thrones came along. {% include image.html id="got" style="float: right; padding: 10px; max-width: 350px" %} And that took 70 hours~! I don't think even the fans of Love Actually want seven seasons of this, but maybe another approach would appease my soul? If you want 9 storylines, what about going deep like Michael Apted's 7up series. He interviews the same group of people every 7 years. That would be 2003, 2010, 2017, 2024. THEN, we'll see Love, actually (heehee). The titles could reflect the sign of the times? Use words from that era?

{% include image.html id="rizz" style="float: right; padding: 10px; max-width: 350px" %}

- 'Love Actually: He Got Game'
- 'Love Actually: Puttin on The Rizz'
- 'Love Actually: The Son Also Rizzes' (for Daniel and Sam)

I dunno....9 storylines? I just can't.
