## The Trailer

## The Details
  
Before I explain, let's start with some questions:

1. Why are there SO many children across 2 sets of parents. Is this the Duggar Family Christmas? Enough that Kevin is ignored.
2. How long did Joe Pesci in the cop uniform stand in the foyer?
3. Also, was Joe Pesci's cop the very first on-screen phishing scam?
4. Would Buzz have an Ice-T poster in 1990? (more likely this 
should've been MC Hammer)
5. A Family Crisis Intervention Sergeant named "[Larry Balzak](https://homealone.fandom.com/wiki/Larry_Balzak)"?(think about it)
6. Del Griffith (Planes, Train, and Automobiles) learned to play the clarinet so he can stalk single women in the airport as the Polka King of the Midwest?

For the real questions, that make Home Alone the weirdest holiday movie

Q1. On Day 2 of aloneness, Kevin feels right at home. Took a shower, used soap, shampoo, and washed all his crevices. He'll even buy a toothbrush he goes out shopping later that day. BUT, he couldn't pack a suitcase despite watching dozens of other kids do it in front of him? (Also, later, he knows how to operate the laundry machines?)

Q2. When getting the pizza delivered to the back door, how is it that Kevin is so good at fast-forwarding the VHS tape to play the perfect audio? 

Q3: If he really wants his family back, and he's become so resourceful around the house, why doesn't he walk to the police or when he's in the church tell an adult? Won't he run out of straight cash, homie?

Q4: Where did Kevin get his sadistic tendencies? Hot iron on the doorknob? Tar and nails on the stairs? These take some mature thinking.

You might be thinking, Adam, this is about having a good time. It's "suspension of disbelief". Just enjoy the movie. The answer ISN'T just suspension of disbelief. 

COULD IT BE, that the answer is that Home Alone is the Christmas comedy version of 2009's Orphan???? {% include image.html id="orphan-poster" style="max-height: 168px" %}

YES. The answer is YES. 

Kevin is ACTUALLY a 33 yr. old male, adopted by his parents, and unbeknownst to all, he possesses the same disorder  as Esther from the movie Orphan (2009). He's a 90s version of Hasbulla. {% include image.html id="hasbulla" style="max-height: 168px" %}
   THIS, my friends, explains 

1. his hidden adult capacity, 
2. why everyone hates the "outsider" and treats him as "less than" 
3. how Kevin has the wherewithal to thwart grown adult burglars.  

THINK ABOUT IT. And let your Christmas viewings of Home Alone forever be improved. Kevin is Hasbulla - a grown man in a little body.
