## The Gist

QUESTIONS
* Why are there SO many children across 2 sets of parents. Is this the Duggar Family Christmas?
* "I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you were growing on my ASS!" - Buzz
* "The salt turns the bodies into mummies" -Buzz
* How long did Joe Pesci stand their in the cop uniform?
* "Look what you did you little jerk!" - Uncle
  * I think it's becuase all the adults are sick of young kids.
* Was Joe Pesci as the cop the very first phishing scam?
* Was this top-nothc parenting?
  * Kevin:"I don't want to see you for th rest of my life." 
  * Mom: "Then say it again, and maybe it'll happen"
  * The wind that night makes it seem like supernatural forces were at work - Santa?
* Would Buzz have an Ice-T poster in 1990? This poster should've been MC Hammer.
* A Family Crisis Intervention Sergeant named "Larry Balzak" with a huge piece of chocolate donut hanging off the phone receiver.
* Day 2 - took a shower, used soap, shampoo, and all crevices. Will buy a toothbrush he goes out. But just 2 days ago he couldn't pack a suitcase despite watching dozens of other kids do it in front of him. This isn't an irregularity, but the focus of clear, and well-rested mind.
