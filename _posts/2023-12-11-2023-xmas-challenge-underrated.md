## The Details

It was released during the pandemic, Doogie Howser opens the film, and most of all - a HORRIBLE title for a movie. These are probably why it has gone ignored. Doogie Howser + Christmas gives off Hallmark channel vibes. But the title - that's not its fault (it was was [based on a book](https://a.co/d/hXNUlVU)). This flick catches wildfire if its renamed to "Nintendo Christmas" (drop the 'N' in Nintendo - inside joke if you've watched the movie). Well maybe not, but i'm terrible with titles. But, here's what's great about it, and what all rewatchable movies have:

1. Interesting Characters 
2. Great Scenes

All good movies have **great** scenes. 8-Bit has them and they are more than just the nostalgia of seeing Nintendo, 80s kids clothes, baseball cards, dental retainers, and black market Cabbage Patch dolls.

Back to Doogie Howser - most of the film is flashback to Doogie as a kid in 1988. He's in the movie about as much as Peter Falk & Fred Savage in The Princess Bride. The characters are interesting, and you are rooting for their wishes to come true. {% include image.html id="steve-zahn" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; padding: 10px" %} {% include image.html id="david-cross" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; padding: 10px" %} Steve Zahn (Doogie's dad) and David Cross (black market toy dealer)  are memorable along with the gang of kids.

It's a slice of life, but best of all, its sweet hearted, good-natured, and has a truly heartwarming ending. Give it a watch!
