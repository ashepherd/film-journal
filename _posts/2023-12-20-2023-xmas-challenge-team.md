## The Gist

* Powell gives McClane the moral support he needs - quickly become partners
  * Twinkie ingredients
  * encouragement (I love you, and so do a lot of the other guys down here.)
* Different in every way - race, body type, & working style - Opposite ends of the spectrum of policing - rogue & yes man  - often portrayed as at odds w. each other. these differening characters find common ground (Love is Blind). 
  * desk duty v. gung-ho
* Payoff - .44 gun blast
* Radio talk - device to reveal more of these characters
  * Holly confession
  * Unsure if he's gonna make it
