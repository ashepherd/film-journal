## The Gist

Sad Christmas films don't mean they should be avoided this time of year. There's a good (and sometimes necessary) place for them. This film is heartbreaking. But, only a good film can do that. 

The saddest part for me is best expressed at the end when two priests debate what is the best way for them to serve. One believes WWI to be a God-ordained holy war. The other priest believes it was God-ordained that he stand along side those men who are suffering. This is the question of film - is it better (or "right") to be inclusive of all or to be exclusive for the few (who agree with you). The characters fo the film get to answer this question in their own ways, and the film succeeds in depicting both sides so well. I hope you check it out.
