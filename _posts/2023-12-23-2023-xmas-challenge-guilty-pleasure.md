## The Gist

Barely a Christmas movie, it's so much fun! Its just the right amount of creepy, way more fun than the first and soundtrack is a killer (Ghostbusters theme song paired with `On Our Own` by Bobby Brown)! While the premise is, clunky it was much needed as the 80s came to an end. a huge river of slime runs underneath NYC, and it's reactive to human emotions (ala The Hidden Messages in Water by Emoto, Masaru). What better location than NYC and its reputation for being rude and insensitive. It's as if writer put all of NYC in the therapy chair. NYC brass denies there's a ghost problem (it's own inner demons), and they refuse to acknowledge them (and call the Ghostbusters). It takes some pretty wild happenings for the city to finally relent (a mink coat that comes to life and attacks its bearer, the Titanic arriving in port, and new born crawling the edge of a high-rise, yikes!!). The villian is clunky and wierd, but who cares. This movie is about us. What does this have to do with Christmas? This all goes down the days after Christmas, when the punch has worn off and we're staring down a New Year. To me, its reminder of the best things about Christmas are the times with friends and family, and wouldn't it be cool to carry that Christmas spirit through out the year. (Ok, that is all a stretch, but it's MY guilty pleasure). Where's my boombox, Bobby Brown?!
